# 🔍 Digital Forensics Repository  

This repository contains a collection of **forensic analysis reports, case studies, lab exercises, and investigative reports** that I have completed during my academic journey in **Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity**. The work is categorized into two primary areas:  

1. **📱 Mobile Forensics** – Covers forensic investigations on Android and iOS devices, including APK analysis, SQLite database extractions, and file system analysis.  
2. **💻 Computer/Digital Forensics** – Encompasses forensic examinations of computer systems, log analysis, hacking case investigations, and forensic methodologies.  

All reports and investigations in this repository are based on **open-source forensic datasets** available on **Digital Corpora**: [https://digitalcorpora.org/](https://digitalcorpora.org/).
